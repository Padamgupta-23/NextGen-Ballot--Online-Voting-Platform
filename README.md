## üîß How To Setup Things

### 1. üì¶ Install Dependencies
Run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. MongoDB connection in .env file:

   ```bash
   MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster01.clagshx.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster01
   PORT=5000
   NODE_ENV=development
   ```
   Replace username and password with your MongoDB Atlas credentials.


### 3. Enable Network Access in MongoDB Atlas

After creating your cluster and getting your connection string, follow these steps:

1. Go to your MongoDB Atlas **Dashboard**.
2. Navigate to **Network Access** under the **Security** section in the left sidebar.
3. Click on **"Add IP Address"**.
4. Select **"Allow Access from Anywhere"** (adds `0.0.0.0/0`).

 > üîí For development only.

5. Click **Confirm**.

 > ‚ö†Ô∏è Without this step, your backend won't be able to connect to your MongoDB cluster.



### 4. Backend (Node Server):

```bash
node server.js
```
